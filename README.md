# Residential-Energy-Appliance-Classification

### What is the project about?
Greenhouse gas emission is one of the important problems that we face today. Thus to combat this problem, energy 
production/consumption has to be monitored. Energy efficiency helps track and cut the rapid demand and growth of global energy 
demands to decommissioning of fossil-fuel power plants and combat climate change. The growing number of population and increasing 
residential buildings has led to a significant increase in demand for energy in the last few decades. Thus using technology to build 
energy-saving techniques will help cut the carbon footprint. Using the right amount of electricity at the right time will increase energy 
efficiency and reduce emissions.The paper entitled â€œPerformance evaluation in non-intrusive load monitoring:Datasets, metrics, and 
tools-A review", gives a brief overview of Load monitoring for appliances used in residential buildings which are air conditioner, electric 
vehicle charger, oven, washing machine and dryer. We can infer from the paper that the load for each of the appliances remains high 
for time when the appliance is in use, and drops significantly when it's off. This pattern of load fluctuation for the appliance can be used 
to predict the appliance usage given the load of a household. 

### What is the goal of the project?
In this project, our target is to find the most accurate prediction for each appliance, whether it is on or off given the load value for a 
residential household and other features like day of the week and hour of the day.

### How the project was done in your group?
For all the steps of performing this project, all three team members were involved and contributed together.
